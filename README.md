# Score API

This project contains source code and supporting files for the [Open Finance Africa](https://openfinance.africa) Payment
Score API. The API is available for consumption at *https//api.openfinance.africa*. The API reference can be found [here](https://app.theneo.io/open-finance-africa/documentation).


## Prerequisites for running locally

In order to test the API locally, you'll use the Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) which is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* [Python 3 installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)


## Using SAM CLI to build and test locally

Build your application with the `sam build --use-container` command.

```bash
scoreapi$ sam build --use-container
```

The SAM CLI installs dependencies defined in `src/requirements.txt`, creates a deployment package, and saves it in the `.aws-sam/build` folder.

Test a single function by invoking it directly with a test event. An event is a JSON document that represents the input that the function receives from the event source. Test events are included in the `events` folder in this project.

Run functions locally and invoke them with the `sam local invoke` command.

```bash
scoreapi$ sam local invoke ScoreApiFunction --event events/event.json
```

The SAM CLI can also emulate the API. Use the command below to run the API locally on port 3001.

```bash
scoreapi$ sam local start-api -p 3001
```


## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
scoreapi$ sam logs -n ScoreApiFunction --stack-name scoreapi --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Tests

Tests are defined in the `tests` folder in this project. Use PIP to install the test dependencies and run tests.

```bash
scoreapi$ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt --user
# unit tests
scoreapi$ python -m pytest tests/unit -v
```


## Formatting
```bash
scoreapi$ pip install black
scoreapi$ black .
```
